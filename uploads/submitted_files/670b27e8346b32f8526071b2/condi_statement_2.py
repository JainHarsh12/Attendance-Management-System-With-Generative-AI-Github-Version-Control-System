# Q.1 An online shopping site offers free shipping on orders over $50. Additionally, if a customer adds more than 3 items to their cart, they receive a 5% discount. Write a Python program that asks for the total cart value and the number of items in the cart, then calculates the final price after applying any discounts and shipping charges.


# Q.2 A car rental service charges $40 per day for economy cars and $70 per day for luxury cars. If the rental period exceeds 7 days, customers get a discount of $10/day on economy cars and $15/day on luxury cars. Write a program that takes the type of car (economy or luxury) and the rental period as inputs, then calculates the total cost.

# Q.3  A bank evaluates loan eligibility based on multiple conditions:
# Applicant must have a minimum monthly salary of $3000.
# Credit score must be 700 or higher.
# If the applicant’s salary is between $2500 and $3000, they can still qualify with a cosigner. Write a Python program that takes the user’s salary, credit score, and cosigner availability as inputs, and determines if the loan can be approved.



# Q.4  An insurance company calculates premiums based on a person’s risk factors:
# Base premium is $500.
# If the person smokes, a surcharge of $200 is added.
# If the person is over 60, a surcharge of $150 is added.
# If the person has a pre-existing medical condition, a surcharge of $300 is added. Write a program that calculates the total premium based on the user's risk factors.



# Q.5  A restaurant dynamically adjusts prices based on the time of day:
# Breakfast (6 AM - 11 AM): 20% off.
# Lunch (11 AM - 4 PM): No discount.
# Dinner (4 PM - 10 PM): 15% off.
# Late-night (10 PM - 6 AM): 10% surcharge.
# Write a program that takes the meal time and base price of a meal as inputs, and calculates the final price based on the time of day.



# Q.6  A university uses multiple factors to decide admission:
# The student must have an SAT score of at least 1200 or an ACT score of at least 28.
# The student’s GPA must be at least 3.5.
# If the student is an athlete or has community service of over 100 hours, they get special consideration and can be admitted with a GPA of 3.0 and lower test scores. Write a Python program that asks for the student’s SAT/ACT score, GPA, community service hours, and athletic status, and determines if the student is admitted.



# Q.7  A car dealership offers a bonus to buyers who purchase fuel-efficient cars. The bonus system is as follows:
# Cars with a fuel efficiency rating over 30 miles per gallon (MPG) receive a $500 rebate.
# Hybrid or electric vehicles automatically receive a $1000 rebate, regardless of MPG.
# Cars with an MPG between 20 and 30 receive no rebate.
# Cars with an MPG below 20 are charged an additional fee of $300 for environmental impact. Write a program that calculates the final cost of the car based on its fuel efficiency and type.



# Q.8  A company awards a performance bonus to employees based on their performance rating:
# Rating of 4.5 or above: 20% of the annual salary as a bonus.
# Rating between 3.0 and 4.4: 10% of the annual salary.
# Rating below 3.0: No bonus, but mandatory training is required. Additionally, employees who have been with the company for over 5 years get an extra 5% bonus. Write a Python program that takes the employee’s rating, salary, and years of service, and calculates the total bonus.




# Q.9  A fitness app tracks users' daily steps and provides rewards based on performance:
# If the user hits their step goal (10,000 steps), they earn 100 points.
# If the user exceeds the step goal by 20% or more, they earn 150 points.
# If the user reaches between 80% and 99% of the goal, they earn 50 points.
# If the user hits less than 80% of the goal, no points are awarded. Write a program that calculates the number of points earned based on the user's step count.



# Q.10  A city monitors air quality and issues warnings based on the AQI (Air Quality Index):
# AQI below 50: "Good" air quality, no action needed.
# AQI between 50 and 100: "Moderate," sensitive individuals should reduce outdoor activity.
# AQI between 100 and 150: "Unhealthy for sensitive groups," outdoor activities should be minimized.
# AQI above 150: "Unhealthy," all residents should avoid outdoor activities. Write a Python program that takes the AQI as input and displays the appropriate warning message.
